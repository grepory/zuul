# Zuul

Dr. Peter Venkman: What I'd really like to do is talk to Dana. Dana? It's Peter.

Dana Barrett: There is no Dana, there is only Zuul.

Dr. Peter Venkman: Oh, Zuulie, you nut, now c'mon. Just relax, c'mon. I want to talk to Dana. Dana, Dana. Can I talk to Dana?

Dana Barrett: [in an inhuman demonic voice] There is no Dana, only Zuul!

Dr. Peter Venkman: What a lovely singing voice you must have.
